# STAT 220

This is a repository for Alex McKeever's work in STAT 220: Introduction to Data Science

### Portfolio Project 1
This project had me create a visualization surronding policing data in Minneapolis.

### Portfolio Project 2
This project had me look at correlations between climate and struggles with weather prediction by wrangling data.

### Portfolio Project 3
This project had me explore State of the Union Addressees using stringr.

### Final Project
Completed with the wonderful Aaryan Gulati, this project was focused on creating a Shiny App. We opted to look at NFL stats. The site can be found here: https://mckeevera.shinyapps.io/HowToWinTheSuperBowl/
